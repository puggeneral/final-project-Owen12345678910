# Computational Thinking Final Project Description

## Overview

You have a few choices for the topic of your final project:
* Focus Day Game or Tool
  * Design a game/tool/program for a middle school focus day. A list of focus days is included in this repo. If you have a favorite that isn't on this list, you may use that too!
  * You may have a physical component, too - see the game boards on the wall as examples.
* [micro:bit](https://python.microbit.org/v/2)
  * Create an interactive game or tool with a micro:bit (a little like the CPX)
  * Use the SmartCar and the micro:bit
* Use [EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/) to create music
* Use Python Turtle to draw (can be combined with the Focus Day project)
* Come up with your own idea. Just be sure to get it approved first!

## General Information
This project involves all of the components of computational thinking: decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm design. You will have different due dates for different components to help you stay on track. The goal is for you to complete this in class. That said, particularly complex games may require more time. Likewise, failure to use class time efficiently may also result in the need to work at home. 

## Required components

This project involves multiple stages and submissions. 

### Stage 0: Proposal (on Canvas)
Submit a brief description of your idea. Get this approved before you put too much into your project in case you need to change plans!

### Stage 1: Decomposition 

The first step is to break down the problem. What are you trying to accomplish? What are the "big things" you need to complete? Then, break those down into smaller pieces. When you have broken the project down into clear and achievable tasks, **make a timeline** for yourself that will allow you to finish on time. Does it seem unreasonable? If not, consider scaling your project back in order to make it achievable!

You will submit a draft of your decomposition and timeline early in the project. Since things will change as you work on your game/tool/etc, you will update your timeline and submit a final version at the end, showing the actual steps and timeline that you used to complete your project.

### Stage 2: Flow Chart

Your flow chart should show the logic flow for your game/tool. It should be clear and easy to follow and should show all steps the user may take in using your game/tool. You will submit a draft early in the process and a final version att the end.

### Stage 3: The Game/Tool/Program

Your game/tool/activity must contain a coding component. You may also have some physical components, such as a game board and playing pieces, if desired. 

Your program must contain the following **(minimum)**:
* Variables (3)
* At least 2 inputs() and 2 prints()
* At least 1 for loop and at least 1 while loop
* At least 2 conditionals (if/else)
* At least 1 function that actually does something useful (and is called at least 2-3 times in your code)
  * This is vague, but the goal is that it serves a purpose as a function. If you're printing 1 or 2 lines, having it in a function doesn't add much value.
* Thorough documentation (comments!)
* Proper style & formatting
* References (for both content and code assistance)
* README updated with title, name, description of project

Additonal requirements: 
* Game is applicable to a MS Focus Day (**optional**), and that day is clearly noted in your documentation
* Project contains enough complexity to be engaging (and educational, if applicable)
* Project contains clear instructions/rules for play
* Any unique materials needed are included
* Standard stationary materials (pens, paper, etc) need not be included

Since each project is different, the requirements for earning "Excellent" will also be different. Your project will need to be significantly more complex than the requirements above and involve some combination of the following:
* Advanced syntax, including passing information into and out of functions, lists and list methods, string methods, etc
* Challenging yourself to use new tools 
* Creating a game or tool that demonstrates complex logic and design
See Megan or Sawyer for help identifying ways to achieve that for your specific project.

### Stage 4: Evaluation & Reflection

After you have submitted your project, you will present it to the class. There will be time for everybody to experience each other's projects and then you will reflect on the process.
